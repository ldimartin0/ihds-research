# Office Hours Meeting 4/21

He does not really do fixed effects
Past student looked at remittances at the household level
Another past student looked at informal loans
Silpa did dropout rates
Meher built off Silpa using diff-in-diff, insignificant

Can always used pooled OLS and diff-in-diff


Remember to control for occupation

He has added outlier code in the do-file

If doing descriptive statistics, might want to use CPI to measure inflation and whatnot to inflation-control price/income numbers

```
local varname_controls "control1 control2"
reg y x `varname_controls'
```
