# Gender Inequality in India - India Human Development Survey

This is the repository for my project on economic gender inequality for INAF-383, Applied Econometrics for Development.

## Data
The data are available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/37382). The data are large enough that I am not storing them on GitHub. I am studying the individual appended long panel and the household appended long panel in a `data` subfolder that isn't listed on GitHub.
