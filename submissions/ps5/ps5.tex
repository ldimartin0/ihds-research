I am analyzing data from the India Human Development Survey. My focus is on gender disparities and the effects of education on them.

My baseline hypothesis, of course, is that there is a difference in wealth and income between men and women. The variables are intuitively named, except \verb|RO3|, which is the indicator for sex.

This is a panel dataset, so first I'll report basic statistics about the balance of the panel, with panel survival by state and by sex.
\begin{stlog}\input{ps5_1.log.tex}\end{stlog}
This $t$-test shows that there is a highly statistically significant naive difference in income between men and women.
\begin{stlog}\input{ps5_2.log.tex}\end{stlog}
This $t$-test shows that there is a highly statistically significant naive difference in hourly wage between men and women --- on average, men earn about 12 rupees more per hour than women.
\begin{stlog}\input{ps5_3.log.tex}\end{stlog}
This $t$-test shows that there is a highly statistically significant naive difference in poverty between men and women --- women are about 1.1 percentage points more likely to be poor.
\begin{stlog}\input{ps5_4.log.tex}\end{stlog}

The histogram of hourly wages has tails far too long to be meaningful, but this histogram grouped by decile shows the difference in the wage distribution between men and women. 
\begin{stlog}\input{ps5_5.log.tex}\end{stlog}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{ps5_5.pdf}

This histogram shows the difference in log hourly wage distributions between men and women.

Going forward, my plan is to clean the income and wage data to get more accurate measures, including determining what to do with outliers and negative results. Then, I will construct control variables from the relevant variables in the survey. From there, I should be able to develop a fundamental OLS model with broad controls.

Then, I will develop a household fixed effects model and investigate potential instruments for gender-equality-related independent variables.
